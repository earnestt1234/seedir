# Changelog

This document will serve as a record for past and future changes to seedir.  It is being retroactively added after the version [0.2.0](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/releases/tag/v0.2.0) release (so notes for prior releases will be less detailed).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## 0.4.0 - in development

### Added

- pathlib Path objects now accepted by `sd.seedir()`.  All other arguments apply as normal; arguments accepting callables (`mask` and `formatter`) will see pathlib objects.

### Changed

- [emoji is now an optional dependency](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/issues/12).  It can be installed with `pip install seedir[emoji]`.  An error is raised if the emoji style is requested without emoji installed.
- Reorganization of `folderstructure.py` and the `FolderStructure` class
  - `folderstructurehelpers.py` has been removed.  Most of the functions implemented there have become methods of `FolderStucture`.
  - FolderStructure has been made more user-friendly, and can now be initialized with less functions.  
  - There are no longer separate "real dir"/"fake dir" functions for handing item filtering/sorting.  

- Item inclusion is now prioritized above exclusion for include/exclude folders/files.  The order of precedence now is mask (1), inclusion (2), exclusion (3).  The code in this function was generally rewritten to be more concise (`FolderStructure._filter_items()`).
- More examples in the getting started readme. 

### Fixed

- Typos in documentation
- Removal of IPYNB checkpoints

### Removed

- The `SeedirError` has been removed.  All uses have been replaced with more appropriate errors, mainly `ValueError` or `TypeError`

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/releases/tag/v0.3.1)

### Added
- Additional functionality to the `formatter` parameter: can now dynamically set other seedir arguments as well as styling ones
- Added a `sticky_formatter` parameter for causing the formatter changes to continue through sub-directories.
- Additional test cases for `formatter`
- Add `folderend` & `fileend` tokens for setting characters at end of line.  Default styles have been updated to include these.
- Additional documentation, specifically for `formatter` but also some smaller tweaks

### Changed
- The CLI was revamped, now using argparse instead of getopts.  More seedir options were added.
- The `seedir.printing.format_indent()` method now modifies dictionaries in place, rather than creating a new one
- the `FakeDir.realize()` method no longer creates a reference to unused file variable

### Fixed
- Fix the words.txt file not being closed after opening ðŸ¤¦

### Deprecated

- `slash` is on warning for removal after addition of `folderend`.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2021-12-20

### Added

- [`formatter` parameter](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/issues/4) for more customizable diagrams
- FakeDir methods for creating files/folders now return references to the objects created
- A `copy()` method for FakeDirs
- A `siblings()` method for FakeDirs

### Changed

- Documentation updates
  - Added code blocks to examples in docstrings
  - replaced the "cheatsheet.png" image in the Getting Started section with a markdown link
  - remove broken link to `FolderStructure` class in `seedir.realdir` module
  - fixed some examples in docstrings and readmes
- in getting started, redo examples to omit empty folders (which are omitted by GitHub)
- replace `'\s'` with `' '` in `seedir.fakedir.fakedir_fromstring()`
- [Remove .DS_Store files](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/pull/5) (thanks @[timweissenfels](https://github.com/timweissenfels))
- Reverted API doc style back to pdoc3 default

### Fixed

- remove [call to `copy` method](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/blob/09fbed86a356fa9b01588546e1e7dbda15812b49/seedir/fakedir.py#L417) in `Fakedir.delete()`, which prevented non-list arguments
- the `walk_apply` method is now applied to the calling folder, rather than just children

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2021-05-21

### Added

- a new `folderstructure.py` module was added containing a single folder tree construction algorithm.  This module is called for both real directories (`seedir.realdir.seedir()`) and fake directories (`seedir.fakedir.Fakedir.seedir()`).  The code was also refactored to be less convoluted and more readable (and also more correct for some fringe cases)
  - using `depthlimit=0` with a `beyond` string now produces just the root folder (this was incorrect before)
  - with `beyond='content'`, empty folders are only shown when the `depthlimit` is crossed
  - trailing separators or slashes no longer cause the name of the root folder to be empty
- A `folderstructurehelpers.py` module was also added to support the main folder structure algorithm.
- More unit tests were added.
- `name` parameter added to `seedir.fakedir.randomdir`
- Convert some arguments to `bool` or `int` in the command line tool

### Changed

- The documentation was overhauled:
  - The Jupyter Notebook examples file was removed, in favor of a `gettingstarted.md` file which is included in the main page of the API docs.
  - The getting started README as well as the `seedir.fakedir` module are now `doctest`-able.
  - New style added to the API docs.
  - `seedir.seedir` module has been renamed to `seedir.realdir` to avoid some of my confusions
  - added an `exampledir` to the `docs` folder for some examples
- Some changes to `seedir.fakedir.fakedir_fromstring` to handle some more failed cases.
- `words`, `FakeItem` removed from package namespace

## [0.1.4](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/releases/tag/v0.1.4) - 2021-03-01

### Added

- Documentation was updated to include code formatting and within-package hyperlinks (thanks to pdoc)

### Changed

- the variable name of the output of `seedir.seedir()` and `seedir.fakedir()` was renamed from `rfs` to `s`

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/releases/tag/v0.1.3) - 2020-12-31

### Changed

- Code block examples added to docstrings, following [this issue](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/issues/3)

## [0.1.2](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/releases/tag/v0.1.2) - 2020-11-28

### Added

- [new `mask` parameter](https://github.com/earnestt1234/seedir/issues/1) for functionally filtering items, used by `seedir.seedir`, `seedir.FakeDir.seedir`, and `seedir.fakedir`
- test cases for the `mask` parameter

### Changed

- Updated examples notebook
- Updated documentation
